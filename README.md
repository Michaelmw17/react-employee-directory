# Employee Directory

## Description

Employee directory is a react app that lets users view a list of random generated users from [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) 
and sort them by first name, last name, age, etc.

Whenever a user clicks the category button (name, age) at the top of each table column, the listed users will be displayed in ascending order by that category.

The app also has  a search bar that allows you to search through the list by names.
