# Employee Directory

## Description:

Employee directory is a react app that lets users view a list of randomly generated users from [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) 
and sort them by name, age, username, etc.

Whenever a user clicks the category button at the top of each table column, the listed users will be displayed in ascending order by that category.

The app also features a search bar that allows you to search through the list by first names.
